# Towards Benchmarking Old Church Slavonic Lemmatization

This repository contains reproducibility scripts for Old Church Slavonic tokenization and lemmatization experiments with Stanza.

The trained tokenizer and lemmatizer model weights are available on Hugging Face:

```text
https://huggingface.co/usmannawaz/old-church-slavonic-tokenizer-lemmatizer
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Scripts

```text
scripts/run_raw_stanza.py
scripts/run_goldtok_stanza.py
scripts/evaluate_conllu.py
```

## Raw-text mode

```text
raw text → retrained tokenizer → official Stanza POS → retrained lemmatizer → CoNLL-U
```

Edit the paths at the top of `scripts/run_raw_stanza.py`, then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_raw_stanza.py
```

## Gold-tokenized mode

```text
gold CoNLL-U tokens → official Stanza POS → retrained lemmatizer → predicted CoNLL-U
```

Edit the paths at the top of `scripts/run_goldtok_stanza.py`, then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_goldtok_stanza.py
```

## Evaluation

Edit the paths at the top of `scripts/evaluate_conllu.py`, then run:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_conllu.py
```

## Model variants

```text
MODEL_VARIANT = "combined"
MODEL_VARIANT = "new-data"
```


## Data availability

The training dataset is not redistributed.

Users should place local input files under `data/` or update paths in the scripts.

Official Stanza pretrained POS models are downloaded by Stanza during execution.
